# Team Generator

## Description:
This repository provides the landing page for my team generator. This CLI will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members.

Please click the link here to access my [repository](https://github.com/floressuarezalvaro/EmployeeSummaryGenerator). Below is a video of how my team generator works. Due to the length of my gif, I was not able to make the dimensions larger so I have included a screenshot of an example below it.
